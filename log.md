---

### Day 2: June 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I've kept going through FreeCodeCamp exercises. Did some applied accessibility.

**Thoughts**: Going back to basics shed some light on things I forgot. Accessibility is more important than it seems. We take things for granted.
I'll start a blog soon.

---

### Day 3: June 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I did more FreeCodeCamp. Did flexbox and css grid.

**Thoughts**: I will do even more today. I really like how CSS grid works.

---

### Day 4: June 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Came up with an idea for the survey form page and refactored the tribute page.

**Thoughts**: When it's difficult to do something you just have to start and that horrible feeling will pass.

---

### Day 5: June 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I brushed up my CSS animation skills with the survey form page.

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking about doing the Javascript 30 challenge by wesbos.

---

### Day 6: June 19, 2018

**Thoughts**: I think it looks nice.

---

### Day 7: June 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I almost finished the survey page.

**Thoughts**: It was all perfect until the very last moment when I broke all the CSS. Frustrating, but tomorrow I will fix it.

---

### Day 8: June 21, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the survey page!

**Thoughts**: It is satisfying to finishe something you started. I should start finishing things I once started and never finished.

---

### Day 9: June 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I went through some syntactic and responsive issues on the survey page, and did some js basics exercises.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I missed the challenge. I think I should do some algorithms challenges like hackerrank

---

**Today's Progress**: Did ES6 and regex exercises on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: I can't find my log for yesterday.

---

### Day 13: June 27, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I finished the object oriented programming section on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: I like that freecodecamp talks about the prototype and explains how it works. I think it should also explain the difference between *classic* object oriented and object oriented with the prototype.
P.S.: I found yesterday's log

---

### Day 14: June 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I finished the functional programming section and intermediate algorithm scripting on freecodecamp.

---

### Day 16: June 30, 2018

**Thoughts**: I always kept some distance from react, but giving it a try will show me things from another perspective.

---

### Day 17: July 01, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I did more react on freeCodeCamp.
